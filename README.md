# Electrochemical Cell

A custom, 3D printable electrochemical cell, in which material characterization in three electrode setup can be performed, was designed and printed. The cell is optimized for being low cost, allowing quick and automated setup of experiments and having a high degree of reproducibility. To develop this design, a team of three persons worked together: Matthias Gramlich, and Bojan Micevski (a technical designer), and Sterling Baird.

See https://accelerated-discovery.org/t/electrode-lifecycle-enhancement-through-computational-testing-and-research-automation/510 and the GitHub issues for further details.

While the full design process and the latest designs and procedures are publicly documented in this repository's GitHub issues, formalized build instructions using GitBuilding are underway (as of 2025-06-24): 

<!--- # This project is documented with GitBuilding

## What is GitBuilding

GitBuilding is an OpenSource  project for documenting hardware projects with minimal
effort, so you can stop writing and GitBuilding. GitBuilding is a python program that
works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. More information on the GitBuilding project, or how
to install GitBuilding please see the [GitBuilding website](http://gitbuilding.io)

## How do I edit the documentation?

To edit the documentation you do not need to install anything, the documentation files can
be opened in a plain text editor such as Windows Notepad, Notepad++, gedit, VS Code, etc.
We recommend installing GitBuilding to preview any changes to the documentation.
GitBuilding also comes with a browser-based editor that has a live display of the final HTML documentation.

If you have ever used [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) you will
notice that the files you are editing are markdown files. GitBuilding uses an extended
markdown syntax (that we call BuildUp). This allows you to keep track of parts in the
documentation. More detailed documentation is available on the
[GitBuilding website](https://gitbuilding.io).
